## Installation

Install the `pyjokes` module with pip:

```console
pip3 install pyjokes
```

## Usage

### Command line

Once installed, simply call `pyjoke` or `pyjokes` from the command line:

```console
$ pyjoke
Why do Java programmers have to wear glasses? Because they don't see sharp.
```

Or add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to see a joke every time you open a terminal!

See `pyjokes --help` for more info.

### Python

You can also access the jokes in your own project by importing `pyjokes` and using the function
`get_joke`:

```pycon
>>> import pyjokes
>>> print(pyjokes.get_joke())
Why do programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas? Because OCT 31 == DEC 25.
```

We support many languages, and have multiple joke categories:

```pycon
>>> import pyjokes
>>> print(pyjokes.get_joke("eu"))  # basque joke
Zer dira 8 Bocabits? BocaByte bat
>>> print(pyjokes.get_joke("es", "chuck"))  # spanish chuck norris joke
El teclado de Chuck Norris no tiene tecla F1, es el ordenador el que le pide ayuda a Ã©l.
```

There is also a `get_jokes` function which returns all the jokes in the given language and category:

```python
import pyjokes

for joke in pyjokes.get_jokes():
    print(joke)
```

Alternatively, use the `pyjokes.forever` generator function:

```python
import pyjokes

for joke in pyjokes.forever():
    # This will go on forever... you're welcome.
    print(joke)
```
