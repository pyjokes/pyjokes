One line jokes for programmers (jokes as a service)

## Installation

Install the `pyjokes` module with pip:

```console
pip3 install pyjokes
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply call `pyjoke` or `pyjokes` from the command line or add it to your `.bashrc`
or `.zshrc` file to see a joke every time you open a terminal.

You can also access the jokes in your own project by importing `pyjokes` and using the functions
`get_joke` and `get_jokes`. Alternatively, use the `pyjokes.forever` generator function:

```python
import pyjokes


for joke in pyjokes.forever():
    # This will go on forever... you're welcome.
    print(joke)
```
